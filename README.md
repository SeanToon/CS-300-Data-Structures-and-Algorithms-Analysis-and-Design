Main Project Problems:

Project One -
Expand pseudocode to meet the rest of the requirements of ABCU. Directly respond to the two requirements; print a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and for a given course, print out its title and prerequisites.

How did I approach the problem?
I began writing pseudocode to follow the requirements for each data type. After writing all the pseudocode, I evaluated the run-time and memory of the code for each data structure. Based on my analysis, I was able to make a recommendation for which data structure would be best to use for the final project.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One roadblock that I encountered while going through the activity was how to correctly evaluate the run-time and memory of the code for each data structure. At first, I didn't remember how to correctly calculate run-times, but I was able to do simple research to refresh my memory and complete the assignment. Analyzing my pseudocode to evaluate runtimes also allowed me to edit and better review my code.

Project Two -
Move forward with the project by writing the final code.

How did I approach the problem?
First, I reviewed all the customer requirements, past assignments, and resources related to the project. I then used sample code of using a hash table that I created as a template to begin with the final code. I edited the code for the new customer requirements and the data that ABCU provided.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were many roadblocks that I encountered while writing the final code. Writing correct code to input, store and use the data that ABCU provided was easy, but I went through a timely process of writing code, debugging and editing to fit the format that ABCU required. 

The projects have expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I have learned many different types of abstract data types and how to apply them in different ways in code. I also have learned how to write many different types of algorithms that I can apply to the numerouse data types. Learning about all of the different data types and algorithms has given me a better understanding about which ones are best to use depending on the requirements of a program and the amount of resources available in order to write the most efficient and effective code possible. The projects have evolved the way that I write programs so that they are maintainable, readable and adaptable. I have learned more about and gained more experience with collecting requirements of a project, choosing the best algorithms, choosing the best data types, writing pseudocode, understanding run-time complexities, debugging, and writing organized, commented, clear, consice code. Although, the practices of writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be used for every language, I now have more experience with using the C++ language.
