Advantages of a hash table data structure:
-	Fast access runtime.
-	Fast printing runtime.
Disadvantages:
-	Do not maintain specific order, may require sorting.
-	Memory usage/ collision handling.

Binary Search Tree

Code	                                    Line Cost	# Times Executes  Total Cost

Print out the course info	                1	        n	      n
                                                                Total Cost    2n

For each prerequisite of course              	1	        n	      n
Print the prerequisite course info	        1	        n	      n
                                                                Total Cost    2n + 2log(n) + 1

Advantages of a binary search tree data structure:
-	Ordered structure.
-	Fast print all runtime.
Disadvantages:
-	Potentially long runtime for finding chosen course.
-	Tree structure requires more memory than other data structures.

Recommendation

My recommended data structure for the data structure that I will most likely use in my code is a hash table. A hash table is the most efficient data 
structure for the project because of its capability to access data the quickest.
All of the data structures have similar runtimes for a print all function, but a hash table will access and print a chosen course the fastest.
